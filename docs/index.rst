Welcome to Zhetapi's documentation!
===================================

Zhetapi is a ``C++14`` machine learning and numerical analysis API that was
built in the hopes of making mathematical computation and algorithmic research
more convenient to users. In the name of convenience and beginner-friendliness,
the API comes with a scripting language, ZHP.

The project is composed to two main parts:

API
---

On one hand, Zhetapi is a library of many C++ functions for applications in
numerical analysis and machine learning.

Scripting Language
------------------

While C++ overloading makes the API convenient for C++ users, the ZHP scripting
language does better through notational convenience. The idea is that the code
should read with elegance alike to a mathematical proof; hence why a lot of
"mathy" terminolgy is used (ie. functions vs. algorithms).
