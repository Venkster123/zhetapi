First of all, what is programming? Programming, or rather computer programming,
is the process of creating a computer application to achieve some result: a
desktop app, a game, device drivers, etc., are all examples of computer
applications. Making nearly all of these requires computer programming.

So, back to the original question: why should you learn computer programming?
Frankly, its because computers are ubiquitous in modern society. Learning
computer programming will not only teach you the skills to creating computer
applications on your own, but the process of learning it will help you gain a
deeper understanding of how computers work.

Even if you are not planning on studying computer science or engineering in the
future, there are many fields that use computers or computer programming to
solve problems (protein folding, fluid dynamics, e.t.c.).
